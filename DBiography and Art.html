<p><font color="white">Donatello was one of the best sculptors during the Renaissance. Fifteenth century Italy witnessed a resurgence of art through the works of Donatello, the greatest and probably the most influential individual artist and sculpture then. Donatello, from an early age, showed signs of making it big in the world of art and sculpture. Pursuing his interest, he apprenticed early and meticulously learned the detailed nuances of the field. As such, he started receiving commissions for his work early on. Famous for his larger-than-life figures, Donatello evolved as an artist; his latter works being a stark contrast to his earlier ones, in terms of innovativeness. He infused emotions to his work, his sculptures denote feelings of suffering, joy, sorrow and happiness through their face and body position. His most famous work was a bronze statue of David, depicting an allegory of civic virtues winning over brutality and irrationality. The statue was one-of-its-kind for it was the first sculpture to stand independently, devoid of any architectural surrounding.</font> </p>

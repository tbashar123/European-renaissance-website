<p><font color="white">Michelangelo was one of the most famous artists of the Italian Renaissance who was born in Tuscany on March 6th, 1475. His work has demonstrated a mixture of psychological insight and so much intensity that has never been seen before. He received many commissions from some of the most richest and powerful people of his day, like popes and others who were involved with the Catholic Church. Some of his most famous work which was the Pieta, David, and the Sistine Chapel were carefully taken care of for future generations, so they can come and appreciate the genius Michelangelo was. Michelangelo always considered himself a sculptor and he was always a perfectionist and this is demonstrated of how he thought of his performance on the Sistine Chapel, which he thought to be underwhelming. He continued to sculpt and paint until his death. An example of his other masterpieces were Moses, the Last Judgement, and Day, Night, Dawn and Dusk. After the 1530s Michelangelo wrote poems and about 300 are still around today. A lot of them talk about how the soul of a human powered by love and kindness can reunited with God. Michelangelo died after a short illness in 1564 at the age of 88. A pieta which he began sculpting in the late 1540s, intended for his own tomb which was remain unfinished but it is now displayed in Florence.</font></p>
